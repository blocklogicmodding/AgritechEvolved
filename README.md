# AgriTech: Evolved

## Core Features

### **Automated Planters**

-   **Basic Planter**: A simple wooden planter that automatically grows crops and saplings without requiring power at a much slower rate. Can't be automated (except to output into a container directly below it). Available in all 11 vanilla wood types.
-   **Advanced Planter**: A high-tech planter with energy consumption, module slots, fertilizer support, and enhanced automation capabilities

### **Machines**

-   **Composter**: Converts organic materials into biomass fuel with configurable input ratios
-   **Biomass Burner**: Generates RF energy from crude biomass, biomass, and compacted biomass
-   **Energy Capacitors**: Three tiers of energy storage (Tier 1: 500k RF, Tier 2: 1M RF, Tier 3: 4M RF)

### **Enhancement Modules**

-   **Speed Modules** (MK1-MK3): Increase processing speed at the cost of higher power consumption
-   **Yield Modules** (MK1-MK3): Boost harvest yields while reducing processing speed

### **Specialized Blocks**

-   **Mulch**: Natural growth accelerator providing 50% speed boost
-   **Infused Farmland**: Premium soil offering 100% growth speed increase

### **Fertilizer System**

Fertilizer support with configurable speed and yield multipliers:

-   Vanilla bone meal
-   Biomass and compacted biomass
-   Mystical Agriculture fertilizers
-   Immersive Engineering fertilizers
-   Forbidden & Arcanus arcane bone meal
