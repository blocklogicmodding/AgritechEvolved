AgriTech: Evolved is a comprehensive agricultural automation mod for Minecraft that enhances farming with advanced machines, modules, and extensive mod compatibility. The mod provides powerful tools for automating crop and tree farming while maintaining balance through configurable energy costs and processing times.

## Core Features

### **Automated Planters**

-   **Basic Planter**: A simple wooden planter that automatically grows crops and saplings without requiring power at a much slower rate. Can't be automated (except to output into a container directly below it)
-   **Advanced Planter**: A high-tech planter with energy consumption, module slots, fertilizer support, and enhanced automation capabilities

### **Agricultural Machines**

-   **Composter**: Converts organic materials into biomass fuel with configurable input ratios
-   **Biomass Burner**: Generates RF energy from crude biomass, biomass, and compacted biomass
-   **Energy Capacitors**: Three tiers of energy storage (Tier 1: 500k RF, Tier 2: 1M RF, Tier 3: 4M RF)

### **Enhancement Modules**

-   **Speed Modules** (MK1-MK3): Increase processing speed at the cost of higher power consumption
-   **Yield Modules** (MK1-MK3): Boost harvest yields while reducing processing speed

### **Specialized Blocks**

-   **Mulch**: Natural growth accelerator providing 50% speed boost
-   **Infused Farmland**: Premium soil offering 100% growth speed increase

### **Fertilizer System**

Comprehensive fertilizer support with configurable speed and yield multipliers:

-   Vanilla bone meal
-   Biomass and compacted biomass
-   Mystical Agriculture fertilizers
-   Immersive Engineering fertilizers
-   Forbidden & Arcanus arcane bone meal

1.  **Mod Compatibility Toggles**: Enable/disable specific mod integrations
2.  **Crop/Sapling/Soil Database**: Comprehensive JSON-based system with TOML overrides
3.  **Balance Configuration**: Fine-tune module effectiveness, power consumption, and processing times

### **Hot Reloading**

Configuration changes apply without server restart, with dedicated error logging for troubleshooting.

## Automation Features

### **Smart Item Handling**

-   Automatic output to adjacent containers
-   Hopper and pipe compatibility
-   Side-specific input/output configuration
-   RF power connections on all sides

### **Interactive Placement**

-   Right-click with seeds to insert directly into planters
-   Right-click with soil blocks for instant placement
-   Right-click with hoes to till compatible blocks
-   Right-click with fertilizers for direct insertion

### **Visual Feedback**

-   Real-time rendering of planted crops and soil types
-   Progress bars for all processing operations
-   Audio feedback for successful interactions
-   Clear error messages for invalid operations

## JEI Integration

Complete Just Enough Items integration showing:

-   Compatible crop/soil combinations for each planter
-   Compostable items for the composter

## Energy System

Uses RF (Redstone Flux) power with configurable consumption rates:

-   Advanced Planter: 128 RF/t base consumption
-   Composter: 128 RF/t base consumption
-   Biomass Burner: Generates up to 2,500 RF/t
-   Module power scaling based on effectiveness
